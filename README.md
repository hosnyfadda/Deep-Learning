# Digit Classification Model

This project implements a neural network model using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the `sklearn` Digits dataset. The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel grayscale images representing digits 0-9.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the digit represented by a given 8x8 pixel image. The neural network is trained using the `train_test_split` method, with dropout regularization technique and batch normalization to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

### Key Features:
- Neural network with dense layers.
- Dropout and batch normalization for regularization.
- Evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics.
- Visualizations of training vs validation accuracy and loss.
